                <p>I am a animator, designer and adventurer from south africa. i have had a passion for good design and fluid animation for as long as i can remember.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I started my journey into animation and design when i left my home town and moved to cape town to study animation. once I started my studies i realised that i had found my passion and what i wanted me career to be. cape town has been a huge influence on my life, from the way i like to design and my colour palletes to the hobbies and adventures i have taken part in.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>adventure and exploration is a big part of who i am. travel and extreme sports have been part of my life from a young age, growing up in a family that valued memories more then possesions led to many incredible adventures from sleeping in caves in the underberg mountain range to horse riding through game parks. i have been fortunate to have traveled extensively within my home country and the opportunity to travel to other countries. so far i have visted lesotho, botswana, zimbabwe, zambia, united kingdom, mexico and canada where i currently am.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>outside of animation and design i have other passions. i love rock climbing, bouldering, kyaking, quidditch, dnd and anything to do with the sea.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>my career has moved away from being on staff to being predominetly a freelancer and working remotely most of the time. i enjoy the freedom of not being tied down to one specific location and constantly challenging myself with new and diffrerent projects.
