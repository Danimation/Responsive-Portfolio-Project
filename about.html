                <p>I am a animator, designer and adventurer from South Africa. I have had a passion for good design and fluid animation for as long as I can remember.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I started my journey into animation and design when I left my home town and moved to Cape Town to study animation. Once I started my studies I realised that I had found my passion and what I wanted me career to be. Cape Town has been a huge influence on my life, from the way I like to design and my colour palletes to the hobbies and adventures I have taken part in.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Adventure and exploration is a big part of who I am. Travel and extreme sports have been part of my life from a young age, growing up in a family that valued memories more then possesions led to many incredible adventures from sleeping in caves in the Underberg mountain range to horse riding through game reserves. I have been fortunate to have traveled extensively within my home country and the opportunity to travel to other countries. So far I have visted Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia, United Kingdom, Mexico, Panama and Canada where I currently am.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Outside of animation and design I have other passions. I love rock climbing, bouldering, kyaking, quidditch, dnd and anything to do with the sea.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>My career has moved away from being on staff to being predominetly a freelancer and working remotely most of the time. I enjoy the freedom of not being tied down to one specific location and constantly challenging myself with new and diffrerent projects.
